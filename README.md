# Snake Game 🐍

This is a classic **Snake Game** built using Python and the **Turtle Graphics** library. The project is part of my Python learning journey as I progress through the **100 Days of Python Code** course.

## Features ✨

- **Classic Gameplay:** Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of your score as the snake grows.
- **Game Over:** Ends the game when the snake collides with itself or the wall.
- **Responsive Design:** Smooth gameplay experience using event listeners.

## Tools & Concepts Used 🛠️

- **Python Turtle Graphics**: For visual rendering and game graphics.
- **Event Listeners**: To capture keyboard input for controlling the snake.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used to structure the game logic and improve reusability.
- **Collision Detection**: For interactions between the snake, food, and boundaries.


## Gameplay Instructions 🎮

- Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake:
  - **Up**: Move up
  - **Down**: Move down
  - **Left**: Move left
  - **Right**: Move right
- Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body to keep playing.


## Future Improvements 🚀

- Add different levels of difficulty.
- Include special power-ups for extra points.
- Implement a high score tracker.
- Create a multiplayer mode.
